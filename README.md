This is the code for our reproduction of parts of Figure 4 of the paper 

> Gallinaro JV, Gašparović N, Rotter S (2022) <br>Homeostatic control of synaptic rewiring in recurrent networks induces the formation of stable memory engrams. <br>PLOS Computational Biology 18(2): e1009836. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009836

This project was done as part of the lecture ```Introduction to Computational Neuroscience``` offerded by the [Computation in Neural Circuits Group](https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/compneuro/home/) at TUM in the Wintersemester 2023.

### Final Result:

### How to use:
<ol>
    <li> Run notebook <code>01_grow_network.ipynb</code>  to generate the data and a preliminary plot <br><strong>Make sure you change the number of threads used!</strong>
    <li> Run notebook <code>02_plot_experiment.ipynb</code> to generate the formated plot used in the presentation
</ol>
